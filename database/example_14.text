Here's an example of how you can structure your code using a separate dbconfig module and a function to handle sessions:

(link unavailable)

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

# Database connection URL
DATABASE_URL = 'sqlite:///mydb.db'

# Create engine and session maker
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)


(link unavailable)

from fastapi import FastAPI
from dbconfig import Session
from models import MyTable

app = FastAPI()

def get_session():
    with Session() as session:
        yield session

@app.get("/mytable/")
def read_mytable(session: Session = Depends(get_session)):
    result = session.query(MyTable).all()
    return result


In this example:

- (link unavailable) contains the database connection URL and creates the engine and session maker.
- (link unavailable) imports the Session object from dbconfig and defines a function get_session to create a session context using the with statement.
- The get_session function is used as a dependency in the read_mytable endpoint, which uses the session to query the database.
- The Depends annotation ensures that the session is created and closed automatically for each request.

By structuring your code this way, you can keep your database configuration separate from your application logic and ensure that sessions are properly managed for each request.
