Here are several example user queries your RAG app will understand and respond to — including summary, generated CSV data, and a chart (with user preferences if specified):

✅ Basic Request (uses all defaults)
"Generate a financial report for 2023 Q1."

✅ Summary: GPT generates a short description of Q1.

✅ Chart: Pie chart (default)

✅ Colors: Default Plotly palette

✅ Title: “Financial Chart”

✅ Customized Chart Type
"Generate a bar chart of revenue by month for Q1 2024."

🧠 GPT will extract:

chart_type: bar

x_axis: Month

y_axis: Revenue

title: “Revenue by Month”

🎨 Colors: Uses defaults if not specified

✅ Customized Colors & Title
"Show a pie chart of product sales. Use red, green, blue colors and title it 'Product Sales Breakdown'."

GPT will return:

chart_type: pie

title: "Product Sales Breakdown"

colors: ["red", "green", "blue"]

✅ Fully Customized
"Generate a line chart showing expenses over months. Title it 'Monthly Expenses'. Colors should be orange and purple."

chart_type: line

title: "Monthly Expenses"

colors: ["orange", "purple"]

✅ Incomplete Input (Triggers defaults)
"Chart my 2023 profits."

If GPT doesn’t extract valid CSV or config:

You’ll still get:

A pie chart

Default colors

Title: "Financial Chart"

Dummy CSV: e.g. Category,Value\nA,50\nB,30\nC,20

Would you like me to generate a few complete mock responses (summary + CSV + chart image preview) as examples next?
