The two methods you mentioned for decoding a JWT token using pyjwt (jwt.decode) serve different purposes and have significant implications for security.

1. Decoding with Public Key
decoded_token = jwt.decode(token, public_key, algorithms=['RS256'])
Purpose:

This approach verifies the JWT token’s signature using the provided public key and the specified algorithm (RS256 in this case).
How It Works:

Signature Verification: The public key is used to validate that the JWT was indeed signed with the corresponding private key, ensuring the token’s authenticity and integrity.
Algorithm: RS256 (or other algorithms) ensures that the token conforms to the expected cryptographic standard.
Security Implications:

High Security: This method ensures that the JWT is valid and has not been tampered with. It confirms that the token was issued by a trusted authority (Keycloak) and has not been modified.
Requires Public Key: You need to obtain and use the correct public key, which should be fetched from the Keycloak JWKS endpoint.
Usage:

This is the recommended approach for verifying JWT tokens when security is a concern, as it ensures the token is both valid and authentic.

2. Decoding Without Signature Verification

decoded_token = jwt.decode(token, options={"verify_signature": False})
Purpose:

This approach decodes the JWT token without verifying its signature. It only parses the payload and header, without checking if the token was actually signed by the issuer.
How It Works:

No Signature Check: The token is decoded and its contents are extracted, but the cryptographic signature is not verified. This means you can read the payload, but you don’t know if it’s trustworthy.
No Algorithm Required: Since signature verification is skipped, the algorithm specified in the JWT header is ignored.
Security Implications:

Low Security: This method is insecure for scenarios where you need to trust the content of the token. Without signature verification, the token could have been tampered with, and there’s no guarantee it was issued by a trusted source.
Use Case: This might be used for debugging or in scenarios where token integrity is not a concern, but it’s generally not recommended for production environments where security is critical.
Usage:

Avoid using this method for production environments or any scenarios where security and token integrity are important. Use it cautiously and only when you fully understand the implications.
Summary
jwt.decode(token, public_key, algorithms=['RS256']): This is the secure and recommended way to decode JWTs in production. It verifies the token’s signature to ensure it is authentic and has not been tampered with.

jwt.decode(token, options={"verify_signature": False}): This skips signature verification, making it unsuitable for secure applications. It only decodes the token without confirming its validity.

For most applications, especially those dealing with sensitive data or requiring secure authentication, you should use the method with public key verification to ensure the integrity and authenticity of JWT tokens.
